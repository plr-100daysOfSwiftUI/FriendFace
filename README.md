Use URLSession to download some JSON from the internet, use Codable to convert it to Swift types, then use NavigationView, List, and more to display it to the user.

A the very least you should:

* Fetch the data and parse it into User and Friend structs.
* Display a list of users with a little information about them.
* Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them.

If you really want to push your skills, think about how to show each user’s friends on the detail screen.

For a medium-sized challenge, show a little information about their friends right on the detail screen. For a bigger challenge, make each of those friends tappable to show their own detail view.

## Day 61 – Time for Core Data

Expand the app so that it uses Core Data.
